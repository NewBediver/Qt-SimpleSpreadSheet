My first try to use Qt for creating programs. This program is a simplified copy of Microsoft Excel written on Qt. To compile and build the project you need any version of Qt-Framework with installed MinGW compiler.

### Main features:
- Perform simple operations like addition/subtraction/multiplication/division and their combinations on numeric data between two or more cells.
- Create/save new spreadsheet projects (all created files use specific structure implemented by me).
- Edit existing spreadsheet projects.
- Default cut/copy/paste/delete operations with simple numeric data and fomulas are supported.
- Searching formulas and any other simple data by means of Find operation.
- Moving to selected cell with usage of Go to cell... function.
- Data sorting and manually recalculation.
- Enabling/disabling grid is supported.
- Additional information inside Help section.
